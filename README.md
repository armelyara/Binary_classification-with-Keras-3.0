**Keras 3.0: Sequential model for images classification**

In this tutorial, you will learn step-by-step the designing sequential model with Keras 3.0 with TensorFlow in backend. 

Otherwise, the data is the forest and mountain images and the Machine Learning problem we want to solve is a binary classification.

Finally, we choose the supervised learning method where the data are labelled (Two class) to address our problem.
